# Question 4: Is an array that is sorted in decreasing order a max-oriented heap
# Answer: Yes

# Question 11: Suppose that your application will have a huge number of insert operations,
but only a few remove the maximum operations. Which priority-queue implementation
do you think would be most effective: heap, unordered array, ordered array?
# Answer: Unordered array as insert costs linear time.

# Question 12: Suppose that your application will have a huge number of find the maximum operations,
but a relatively small number of insert and remove the maximum operations.
Which priority queue implementation do you think would be most effective:
heap, unordered array, ordered array?
# Answer: Ordered array
